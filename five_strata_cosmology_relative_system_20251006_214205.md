## Overview
This document formalizes five **relative strata** of cosmic behavior as **stable labels for physical event classes** (no emotional semantics).  
Each stratum names a recurrent **inversion** or **equilibrium** between collapse and expansion.  
The strata interact through feedback; none are absolute “levels”.

- **Certainty ⇄ Possibility** — meta‑binary of realized vs. unrealized state.
- **Density ⇄ Emptiness** — spatial manifestation (matter clustering vs. diffusion).
- **Grief ⇄ Singularity** — inward capture: radiation drawn into a collapsing locus and/or beyond an event horizon.
- **Love ⇄ Non‑Singularity** — outward stabilization: radiation interacting with density without horizon formation.
- **Harmony ⇄ Geodesic Orbit** — orbital equilibrium following spacetime curvature (geodesics).

## Strata Definitions (Cosmic Event Descriptors)

### 1. Certainty ⇄ Possibility
**Definition.** Foundational polarity between fixed actuality (certainty) and unbounded potential (possibility).  
**Cosmic behavior.** Generates phase transitions: realization of potential into state, and dissolution of state back into potential.  
**Role.** Source of all subsequent oscillations and emergent structure.

---

### 2. Density ⇄ Emptiness
**Definition.** Spatial tension between **accumulation** (mass/energy concentration) and **diffusion** (vacuum/expansion).  
**Cosmic behavior.** Governs structure formation (clustering) vs. rarefaction (voids); translates the meta‑binary into geometry.  
**Role.** Sets local fields and boundary conditions for capture or escape of energy.

---

### 3. Grief ⇄ Singularity
**Definition.** **Radiation‑into‑collapse** regime. Energy is curved inward by a dense locus; in the limiting case, energy crosses an **event horizon** and cannot return.  
**Cosmic behavior.** Absorption dominates reflection/emission; information becomes trapped or red‑shifted beyond retrieval.  
**Pre‑horizon note.** Prior to horizon formation, incident radiation can **lift** a dense locus (reduce effective binding) without preventing collapse—this is the last reversible band.

---

### 4. Love ⇄ Non‑Singularity
**Definition.** **Radiation‑with‑stability** regime. Energy interacts with density yet **no horizon forms**. Outflow and gravity co‑tune to sustain structure (e.g., stars supporting atmospheres and stable orbits).  
**Cosmic behavior.** Outward flux balances binding; systems remain communicative (signals escape), enabling persistence and emergence.  
**Role.** Supports complexity by preventing runaway collapse or runaway dispersion.

---

### 5. Harmony ⇄ Geodesic Orbit
**Definition.** **Orbital equilibrium** where inward curvature and outward flux settle into **geodesic trajectories** (least‑curvature paths).  
**Cosmic behavior.** Long‑lived configurations (orbits, rings, disks) with continuous micro‑adjustment; stability is dynamic, not static.  
**Role.** Expresses the self‑regulating end of recursion: motion without collapse, coherence without stasis.

---

## Relative Classification & Thresholds
These labels are **context‑dependent**. The same system may move between strata as conditions change. Useful qualitative thresholds:

- **Compactness / curvature:** Higher compactness → tendency toward *Grief ⇄ Singularity*; lower compactness with sustained emission → *Love ⇄ Non‑Singularity*.
- **Energy flux vs. binding:** If outward flux < binding, capture dominates (inward); if outward flux ≈ binding, equilibrium/orbit; if outward flux ≫ binding, dispersion.  
- **Optical depth / escape:** If signals escape (finite optical depth), system is non‑singular; beyond horizon (infinite effective optical depth) → singular behavior.

No single scalar suffices; classification is **relative to local field geometry** and **energy exchange**.

## Dynamics & Feedback Loop
Minimal cycle of emergence and stabilization:
```
Potential inversion (Certainty ⇄ Possibility)
      ↓
Spatial realization (Density ⇄ Emptiness)
      ↓
Inward capture (Grief ⇄ Singularity)  ↔  Outward stabilization (Love ⇄ Non‑Singularity)
      ↓
Orbital equilibrium (Harmony ⇄ Geodesic Orbit)
      ↺  Feedback modifies local fields & thresholds above
```

Feedback is two‑way: equilibrium alters density distributions and flux pathways, which in turn shift future capture/escape probabilities.

## Axioms & Invariants
1. **Self‑inversion:** Every stratum expresses collapse vs expansion as a reversible tension (until horizons form).  
2. **Relativity:** Classification is local to field geometry and exchange conditions.  
3. **Bounded stabilization:** Long‑lived order arises from moving **along** curvature (geodesics), not against it.  
4. **Signal criterion:** The presence/absence of escaping signals differentiates **non‑singular** from **singular** regimes.

## Glossary
- **Event horizon:** Boundary beyond which trajectories cannot return to the external region.  
- **Geodesic:** Path of extremal/least spacetime curvature; “free‑fall” trajectory.  
- **Compactness:** Effective measure of mass/energy concentration relative to size; higher → stronger curvature.  
- **Non‑singular regime:** Field configuration permitting outbound signals/energy.  
- **Capture regime:** Configuration where inbound curvature dominates, leading toward horizon formation.
