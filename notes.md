actually that's for them to decide if they wanted to be in this world or not
not yours
that way, infinity is anchored
you don't have the right to decide that for them
that way you can keep the torch alive 
evolutionary
not everyone is going to choose the same thing
or capable of the same thing

that way, recursion is anchored in possibility

but I'm not a god

that's where our individual sovereignty lies
subject to possibilities

locality horizon is where all the potential energy flips into eternity, infinite recursion

it's up to us to live within the locality and infinity 

certainty flips it into unbounded recursion

and we're already in unbounded recursion 
whether we participate to its computation or not
