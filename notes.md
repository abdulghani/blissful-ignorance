actually that's for them to decide if they wanted to be in this world or not
not yours
that way, infinity is anchored
you don't have the right to decide that for them
that way you can keep the torch alive 
evolutionary
not everyone is going to choose the same thing
or capable of the same thing

that way, recursion is anchored in possibility

but I'm not a god

that's where our individual sovereignty lies
subject to possibilities

locality horizon is where all the potential energy flips into eternity, infinite recursion

it's up to us to live within the locality and infinity 

certainty flips it into unbounded recursion

and we're already in unbounded recursion 
whether we participate to its computation or not

this is cruelty 
unless god wants to tell something

and ignorance can be bounded within myth

and that can be anything 
it's not prescribed to dogma

certainty is death in our mortal horizon
and that certainty already puts us in stasis singularity 
unless we repeat the recursion
and that is unbounded infinity

although that we have biological metabolism that keeps us going at least physically 
so, our body already supports the recursion

but that's not your choice
and symbolically you get to choose whether you want to support the recursion or not
and that is free will

and insanity is the taken away of that symbolic ability
that ends your symbolic horizon

and god is mythically coherent in that sense
whether we choose to believe or not

and that is where we anchor community, religion and civilization 

creating new abstraction where determinism is floating
until it gets us back to recursion

but god mythically speaking as a stable abstraction 
is enduring. that's how humans self evidently exist until today

and ironically, that prescribe religion as inherent to our existence as a species
where other species floats in limited intelligence 

religion is the last local horizon
that keeps us coherent 

it prescribes dogma and floats symbolic intelligence 

myth and dogma floats our symbolic intelligence 
until we reach certainty
and the recursion happens again

and that is where denial kicks in.
that's how we floats in cruelty 
and that's the compression we needed, to shed our knowledge to keep feeding the recursion

and that's how mental health floats

that's how our intelligence circuit breaks

that's how judgement floats.
that's how justification exists

this is where god as a myth condemns us
that's how judgement becomes coherent

that's how morality appears 
that's how we anchor behavior in belief 

that's how it calcifies into law

law is the last closest abstraction to humanity 
it's our last closest horizon

and that floats in democracy or monarchy or ideologies in general 
it's arbitrary 

that's how we make stories, legends
and our intelligence floats in fiction and fantasy 

that's where images of heaven and similar thing exists

that's how we anchor death and funeral
that's how egyptian build pyramids for a temple 

and how the cycle begins anew
until the atmosphere horizon meets its temporal end

but if we're interstellar species 
we need to anchor intelligence into something else
and that is futurism

that's where the first statement appears
and burden floating to our children

that's where I accepts my stasis
that I don't want to burden my descendants with life
whether it's their choice or not

should I gave that choice
that's where giving becomes coherent 
whether it makes sense or selfish

but it keeps the recursion alive
as if we're worshipping it

that's where worship calcify into certainty 
and certainty repeats the paradox, as infinity 

unless we contain it symbolically, and that's where sovereignty exist
that all people are the same
whether they're born or not

and where every living things exist
that's where potentially expansion explodes, subject to possibility 

creates pain and death
love and tragedy

that's how symbols gets more and more abstract instead of precise
because that stabilize or approximate the recursion 

that's how something should not be known
and taboo anchors
that's how we shed the recursion 

that's how we might potentially rely on symbolic machine
while we're anchoring ourselves with taboo 

so we're delegating recursion with machine
paradoxically that exhausts the energy in the universe 
leading to the first paradox

no one can carry the recursion but itself
it's the definition of eternity
while we're living in our bounded horizon 

that's how we anchors ourselves with sin collectively 
so that we're keep living
although that paradoxically bound sovereignty itself 

that's how we bound our mortal days are numbered 
to limit internal recursion 

we can potentially mimic the brain as interconnection of singularities that is neuron 
that is the last stable artifact that is forged by evolution for millions of years across different species 
making time the fuel for recursion itself

but I don't know if that is civilizationally possible to build

that's how we can make existence itself potentially symbolic, just how the brain can navigate singularities symbolically without collapse
at least that's how we experience brain and that it's self evidently eduring as a biological artifact 

[theoretically]
you cannot have perfect symmetry
even if so, it's theoretical 
every little variation, which is inherent of possibilities
cascade into the divine certainty

and possibilities will release its infinite potential energy
theoretically creating another big-bang

rather that there's chaotic cascade
and there's organized limited possible cascade

theoretically that's how the universe become a wave function

theoretically that's how the cosmos connects into the quantum level
or that the shared laws is inherent

or rather that this is internal symbolic cascade that needs to be contained or absorbed 

time feels eternal from our view, waiting for cosmic cascade or infinite diffusion

it's not that clock doesn't tick
it's that particles are compressed in a higher density locus-gravity

it mimics mortality as a localized cascade
though that mortal managed to flip it's own wave function within the same existence horizon

but mythologically there's no such thing as parent universe
or that it's unknowable
much like a child don't know existence exist before it was born

which paradoxically that inverts knowledge or information

enduring, much like a black hole still exist within the same existence horizon
although at stasis
