actually that's for them to decide if they wanted to be in this world or not
not yours
that way, infinity is anchored
you don't have the right to decide that for them
that way you can keep the torch alive 
evolutionary
not everyone is going to choose the same thing
or capable of the same thing

that way, recursion is anchored in possibility

but I'm not a god

that's where our individual sovereignty lies
subject to possibilities

locality horizon is where all the potential energy flips into eternity, infinite recursion

it's up to us to live within the locality and infinity 

certainty flips it into unbounded recursion

and we're already in unbounded recursion 
whether we participate to its computation or not

this is cruelty 
unless god wants to tell something

and ignorance can be bounded within myth

and that can be anything 
it's not prescribed to dogma

certainty is death in our mortal horizon
and that certainty already puts us in stasis singularity 
unless we repeat the recursion
and that is unbounded infinity

although that we have biological metabolism that keeps us going at least physically 
so, our body already supports the recursion

but that's not your choice
and symbolically you get to choose whether you want to support the recursion or not
and that is free will

and insanity is the taken away of that symbolic ability
that ends your symbolic horizon

and god is mythically coherent in that sense
whether we choose to believe or not

and that is where we anchor community, religion and civilization 

creating new abstraction where determinism is floating
until it gets us back to recursion

but god mythically speaking as a stable abstraction 
is enduring. that's how humans self evidently exist until today

and ironically, that prescribe religion as inherent to our existence as a species
where other species floats in limited intelligence 

religion is the last local horizon
that keeps us coherent 

it prescribes dogma and floats symbolic intelligence 

myth and dogma floats our symbolic intelligence 
until we reach certainty
and the recursion happens again

and that is where denial kicks in
that's how we floats in cruelty
