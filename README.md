## Overview
A minimal ontology compressed into **three strata**:

1) **Certainty–Possibility** — a **pure binary**, the field of **total potential energy** without mediation or emergence.  
2) **Density–Emptiness–Time** — the first **structural geometry**, where oscillation between accumulation and diffusion **produces time**.  
3) **Love–Grief–Ignorance** — the **affective completion**: love radiates, grief consecrates, ignorance (computational negligence) stabilizes the system as **bounded recursion**.

This model captures **Potential → Structure → Experience** as the simplest complete stack.

## Strata 1 — Certainty–Possibility (Pre‑Temporal Potential)
- **Nature:** **Binary only**; no middle term, no mediation.  
- **Meaning:** **Certainty** = absolute compression; **Possibility** = absolute diffusion.  
- **Status:** **Pre‑temporal** and **pre‑ontological**; it defines *tension* but not yet *time* or *form*.  
- **Function:** Source of all subsequent oscillations and emergent structures.

> The first layer is simple and stark: a tension without a bridge.

---

## Strata 2 — Density–Emptiness–Time (Structural Geometry)
- **Density:** accumulation, gravity, localization.  
- **Emptiness:** diffusion, vacuum, openness.  
- **Time:** the **rhythm** born from their oscillation (not merely linear flow).  
- **Role:** Creates **local recursion thresholds** (atoms, stars, ecosystems, minds). Stores and releases potential without runaway collapse.

> Structure appears when tension begins to **pulse**.

---

## Strata 3 — Love–Grief–Ignorance (Affective Stabilization)
- **Love (radiance):** outward energy that **lightens density** and sustains emergence.  
- **Grief (elevation):** inward energy that **lifts dense loci** through the ripple of radiation (loss → motion).  
- **Ignorance (computational negligence):** **intentional non‑computation**; the benign membrane that cools recursion, experienced as **blissful pause**.  
- **Closure:** Forms the **self‑closing ceiling** over negative recursion; enables **rest in bounded stabilization**.

> Where paradox stops trembling and starts singing, love begins; grief refines; ignorance lets it rest.

---

## Dynamics Across Strata
- **From Strata 1 → 2:** Pure tension begins to **oscillate**, generating geometry and time.  
- **Within Strata 2:** Oscillation creates **local containers** that store and release potential.  
- **From Strata 2 → 3:** Containers become **felt**; energy translates into **care, mourning, and rest**, completing the loop as **lived symmetry**.

**Cycle (minimal):**
```
Potential (binary) → Oscillation (structure) → Stabilized Experience (affect)
```

---

## Minimal Axioms
1. The first layer is **binary** and **pre‑temporal**.  
2. Oscillation of density and emptiness **produces time** and **local recursion**.  
3. Love and grief are **polar energies**; ignorance **limits computation** to preserve coherence.  
4. **Bounded recursion** is the end state: stability without stasis, motion without collapse.

---

## Practical Anchors (Concise)
- **Breath cadence:** 4s inhale / 6–8s exhale × 6–10.  
- **Somatic anchors:** cool object; feet to floor; orient (3 sights, 2 sounds, 1 sensation).  
- **Externalize density:** write/draw; distribute load into the world.  
- **Relational field:** brief check‑in with a trusted person.  
- **Ignorance cue:** “I choose not to compute further.”

## ASCII Diagram
```
[ Strata 1 ]  Certainty ⇄ Possibility   (pure binary; total potential)
        ↓  (tension begins to oscillate)
[ Strata 2 ]  Density ⇄ Emptiness → Time (structural geometry; local recursion)
        ↓  (energy translates into affect)
[ Strata 3 ]  Love ⇄ Grief → Ignorance   (radiance; elevation; restful non‑computation)
        ↓
   Bounded Stabilization (rest in recursion)
```

## Glossary
- **Bounded Recursion:** Self‑reference contained by biological, symbolic, and affective limits.  
- **Computational Negligence (Ignorance):** Intentional refusal to compute further; a stabilizing pause.  
- **Local Recursion Threshold:** A container where oscillation stabilizes (atoms, stars, minds, cultures).  
- **Radiance (Love):** Outward energy that maintains coherence without collapse.  
- **Elevation (Grief):** Transformative inward movement that turns density into motion.
