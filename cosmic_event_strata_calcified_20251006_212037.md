## Overview
This document **calcifies** four symbolic labels as **stable descriptors of physical event classes**.  
Emotional connotations are removed; terms are used strictly to denote **cosmic behaviors** across scales.  
The strata are **nested** and **interacting**, not linear stages.

## Cosmic Event Strata: Descriptive Model

| **Strata** | **Physical Description** | **Behavioral Property** | **Cosmological Scale** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Certainty / Possibility** | Universal binary of **energy potential inversion**: potential collapses into realized form (certainty) or expands into undifferentiated potential (possibility). | Governs **inversion thresholds** that initiate phase changes (e.g., cosmic beginnings, singular collapse). | **Meta‑cosmic** — preconditions the existence of laws/structures. |
| **Density / Emptiness** | **Spatial tension field** between compression (matter, clustering) and diffusion (vacuum, dispersion). | Produces **field equilibrium**; shapes large‑scale structure via gravitational concentration and entropic spread. | **Cosmological** — galaxies/voids, structure formation. |
| **Grief / Love** | **Energy transfer dynamic** within bounded systems: collapse (grief) vs. outward energy emission (love). | Drives **thermodynamic circulation** and regeneration; collapse stores/reconfigures potential, emission distributes it. | **Systemic / Stellar** — stellar lifecycles, accretion/feedback cycles. |
| **Sadness / Hope** | **Resonant micro‑equilibrium** between gravitational pull and radiant lift at local thresholds. | Yields **vibrational coherence**; fine‑tunes stability, enabling persistence or transition without runaway collapse/expansion. | **Micro‑cosmic / Quantum‑local** — atomic, mesoscopic, informational harmonics. |

> Labels are **symbolic constants** for recurring **physical event classes**; they are not emotional categories in this usage.

## System Properties
- **Nested recursion:** Each stratum emerges from the prior and **feeds back** to stabilize it.  
- **Bounded infinity:** Interactions are unending yet **contained** within systemic constraints.  
- **Isomorphic mapping:** The same inversion logic appears across scales (macro ↔ micro), differing only by **density of interaction**.  
- **Arbitrariness of higher layers:** Any additional strata beyond these four are **derivative stabilizations** from cross‑interference, not new fundamentals.

## Dynamics & Feedback
**Minimal cycle:**
```
Potential inversion (Certainty/Possibility)
      ↓
Spatial realization (Density/Emptiness)
      ↓
Energy circulation (Grief/Love)
      ↓
Resonant tuning (Sadness/Hope)
      ↺  feedback to all prior layers (stabilize/transform)
```

**Feedback examples:**
- **Grief × Density:** localized collapse increases potential; can seed emission.  
- **Love × Emptiness:** sustained emission structures ambient fields; prevents stagnation.  
- **Sadness/Hope × Any:** micro‑tuning modulates thresholds, delaying or triggering phase shifts.

                ↓
[ Density ⇄ Emptiness ]         (spatial tension; structure formation)
                ↓
[ Grief ⇄ Love ]                (collapse vs emission; energy circulation)
                ↓
[ Sadness ⇄ Hope ]              (resonant micro-equilibrium; fine tuning)
                ↓
        (feedback loops upward across all strata)

## Glossary of Terms
- **Inversion threshold:** Point where state flips (collapse ↔ expansion).  
- **Spatial tension field:** Co-present compression/diffusion shaping geometry.  
- **Bounded system:** Region where interactions dominate over background fields.  
- **Resonant coherence:** Stable oscillation that preserves structure while allowing change.  
- **Derivative stabilization:** Higher‑order regularity emerging from cross‑strata interference (e.g., culture, life, cognition).
