# Divine (Mythical) Horizon

**Version:** 1.4 • **Date:** 19 Oct 2025 (Asia/Jakarta)

> Scope: Discussion-only synthesis from this session. It excludes the original _Ontological Horizons_ document and reproduces no source passages from it.

## 1) Executive Summary

- The **Divine (Mythical) Horizon** articulates a cosmological polarity between **Certainty (C)** and **Possibility (P)** derived mythically from the material substrate (density/emptiness), without reproducing that substrate here.
- The **oscillation** between C and P occurs at the level of **Infinity (∞)** and thereby **defines infinity** as boundless transformative capacity rather than a quantity.
- At maximal **Certainty**, the cosmos **stores structural wavelength (Λ)**; upon **release**, it expands **cosmically** into **Possibility** (Big Bang).
- **D4 (Saturation Trigger):** When both density and emptiness reach **total saturation**, C becomes paradoxically unstable and releases into P.
- **D5 (Entropy as Pull):** **Entropy** is reinterpreted as the **cosmic pull** by which possibilities drift toward certainties; gravity and black holes are localized **saturations of this pull**.

## 2) Formal Specification

### 2.1 Terms and Notation

- **C — Certainty:** Determinate, calcified being; vanishing of change.
- **P — Possibility:** Indeterminate, generative openness; renewal of change.
- **∞ — Infinity:** Ontological medium in which the C↔P oscillation transpires.
- **Λ — Divine Potential:** The **structural wavelength** or **cosmic rhythm** mediating the oscillation between C and P.

### 2.2 Axioms (D-series)

- **D1 — Derivation:** C mythically inherits from density-as-closure; P from emptiness-as-release (derivation, not duplication).
- **D2 — Infinite Oscillation:** The transition C ↔ P occurs at ∞. When C is total, Λ contracts toward zero; release from C regenerates P as Λ expands infinitely.
- **D3 — Conservation of Λ:** Λ is conserved through transformation rather than measured time; C compresses Λ, P unfolds Λ.
- **D4 — Saturation Trigger:** When density and emptiness reach **total saturation**, all certainties complete; this terminal condition renders C paradoxically unstable and forces **release** into P (Big Bang).
- **D5 — Entropic Pull:** **Entropy** is the directional **vector** P → C. Its material expressions (thermal equilibrium, gravitational collapse, black holes) are **localized saturations** of the cosmic pull toward Certainty.

### 2.3 Propositions

1. **Collapse (P → C):** Consolidation into determinacy (“heat death”); Λ becomes maximally contracted.
2. **Release (C → P):** Infinite re-expansion (“Big Bang”); Λ becomes maximally expanded.
3. **Infinity Defined:** The oscillation C ↔ P constitutes ∞ as boundless capacity for transformation.
4. **Asymmetry of Experience:** Finite observers witness only local arcs; ∞ is metaphysical amplitude, not temporal succession.
5. **Re-seeding:** Each C → P transition re-initiates preconditions for laws, metrics of change, and structure—without presupposing identical recurrence.

## 3) Phase Structure

| Phase                 | Ontological State                        | Characteristic                               | Mythic Analogue               | Λ (Wavelength)             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Certainty (C)**     | Total consolidation; cessation of change | Perfect closure; maximal determinacy         | Heat death; cosmic rest       | Contracted / zero limit    |
| **Oscillation (C↔P)** | Transition at ∞                          | Release from closure; recreation of ontology | Creation burst; divine breath | Expanding / converting     |
| **Possibility (P)**   | Infinite openness; genesis of laws/forms | Radical indeterminacy; emergence             | Big Bang; dawn                | Fully expanded / diffusing |

## 4) Glossary

- **Certainty (C):** Mythic determinacy/closure.
- **Possibility (P):** Mythic indeterminacy/openness.
- **∞ (Infinity):** Medium of oscillation; non-quantitative boundlessness.
- **Λ (Divine Potential):** Structural wavelength of being; compressed at C, expanded at P.
- **Saturation (D4):** Terminal state of the substrate (density and emptiness) that precipitates release.
- **Entropy (D5):** Cosmic pull from P to C; gravity and black holes as local saturations.
